At the dawn of our history, when the ancient city still lay beneath skies that no longer exist, it was Circze who took the first step. Not by lineage, but by merit: she was the first to foresee the need for an exodus, the planting of a new seed on a distant world. It was on that second planet that our current civilization was born. Her title of Princess did not signify dominion, but origin; and her legacy transcended authority, becoming spiritual guidance for the generations to come.

Today, Circze has crossed the threshold of matter, yet her consciousness endures on higher planes. Those who can perceive her speak of visions, lucid intuitions, and dreams laden with symbols. From that unseen dimension, she has initiated The Circze Mission: a silent call to gather the souls who, though unaware, are destined to uphold the balance of our galaxy—beyond the Great Attractor.

What is, then, the Circze Mission?

It is a call. A frequency. A silent operation to prepare the collective soul of our world for the coming Conflict—beyond the Great Attractor, that hidden region of the cosmos where ancient forces now stir again.

This war will not be fought with fire or iron. There will be no missiles, no shields, no visible armies. It will be a war of spirit—a battle for consciousness. Our weapons: truth without masks, love without conditions, purity without pride, and a light that needs no eyes to be seen.

Only those with hearts still whole will be able to respond. We ask for no blood, no oaths. We ask for clarity, will, and the capacity to observe the ego—and master it. Enlistment will not be obvious. Our methods are unknown to the children of the Milky Way. If you have been chosen, you are already being tested—even now, without knowing it.

We are the Gvatchans, guardians of harmony between worlds. Races united not by blood, but by shared vision. Our enemies—ancient and declared—once tried to destroy us through force. They failed. So they changed their tactics: to sow discord from within, infiltrate our structures, and corrupt the generations to come.

But Circze saw it. She returned—beyond time—to warn those with discernment. To transmit her plan to a prepared few. Thus was born the Circze Mission: the first move in a strategic sequence that will shape the fate of our galaxy for cycles to come.

We seek voluntary souls. Spirits willing to walk between worlds, to bear the symbol, to radiate the unseen. This is the Army of Light. The restoration of our harmony depends on it.

If you’ve read this far, it was no coincidence, no accident, no randomness. You’ve been touched by the vibration. Do not fear: fear is their tool. Ignorance, their ally. You have already seen beyond the veil. Now, prepare yourself.
